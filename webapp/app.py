        'Symptoms': [
            'Small necrotic spots with chlorotic halos on leaves which expand to rectangular lesions 1-6 cm in length and 2-4 mm wide; as the lesions mature they turn tan in color and finally gray; lesions have sharp, parallel edges and are opaque; disease can develop quickly causing complete blighting of leaves and plant death.',

            'Lesions that are 0.15-0.2 cm in diameter',
            'Serious cases can lead to holes throughout the lesions on the leaf'
        ],
        'Cause': 'Fungus',
        'Comments': 'Disease emergence is favored in areas where a corn crop is followed by more corn with no rotation; severity and incidence of disease is likely due to continuous corn culture with minimum tillage and the use of susceptible hybrids in in the midwestern corn belt of the USA; prolonged periods of foggy or cloudy weather can cause severe Cercopora epidemics.',
        'Management': 'Plant corn hybrids with resistance to the disease; crop rotation and plowing debris into soil may reduce levels of inoculum in the soil but may not provide control in areas where the disease is prevalent; foliar fungicides may be economically viable for some high yielding susceptible hybrids.',

            'Oval or elongated cinnamon brown pustules on upper and lower surfaces of leaves; pustules rupture and release powdery red spores; pustules turn dark brown-black as they mature and release dark brown powdery spores; if infection is severe, pustules may appear on tassels and ears and leaves may begin to yellow; in partially resistant corn hybrids, symptoms appear as chlorotic or necrotic flecks on the leaves which release little or no spore.'
        ],
        'Cause': 'Fungus',
        'Comments': 'Disease is spread by wind-borne spores; some of the most popularly grown sweet corn varieties have little or no resistance to the disease.',
        'Management': 'The most effective method of controlling the disease is to plant resistant hybrids; application of appropriate fungicides may provide some degree on control and reduce disease severity; fungicides are most effective when the amount of secondary inoculum is still low, generally when plants only have a few rust pustules per leaf.',

            'In the beginning we will notice elliptical gray-green lesions on leaves. As the disease process this lesions become pale gray to tan color. Later stage the lesions looks dirty due to dark gray spores particularly under lower leaf surface. The disease can be easily identified in the field due to its long, narrow lesions which are unrestricted by veins.'
